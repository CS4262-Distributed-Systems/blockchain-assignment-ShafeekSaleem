Blockchain Concepts

1. Smart Contracts and Chaincode

A smart contracts can be considered as governing transactions, whereas chaincode governs how smart contracts are packaged for deployment. A smart contract is defined within a chaincode. Multiple smart contracts can be defined within the same chaincode.

2. Consensus

A consensus mechanism is a fault-tolerant mechanism that is used in computer and blockchain systems to achieve the necessary agreement on a single data value or a single state of the network among distributed processes or multi-agent systems, such as with cryptocurrencies. It is useful in record-keeping, among other things. 

Consensus algorithms that are widely used in blockchain systems are:

    Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin and Ethereum)
    Proof of Stake (used by Ethereum)
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (used by Hyperledger)
